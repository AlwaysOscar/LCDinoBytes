## Technical Overview

### Player State Machine
The dinosaur's behavior is governed by a simple yet effective state machine. The program determines the dinosaur's current actionâ€”running, jumping, or duckingâ€”by checking the status of boolean flags on every cycle. This constant evaluation of state and keypad input allows the dinosaur to seamlessly transition between actions, creating a responsive feel.

### Obstacle Generation
The game creates the illusion of an endless course by recycling a single obstacle. After spawning off-screen on a random row, the obstacle marches leftward. To ensure this is truly unpredictable, the game seeds its random number generator by reading the electrical noise from a floating Analog-to-Digital Converter pin. Once the obstacle clears the screen, its position is reset, and a new random type is assigned, ensuring a continuous challenge.
